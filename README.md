This is a repository dedicated to compiling and finishing all the content from the leaked builds of Project M.

CC stands for "Community Complete/Completion", which means that it's open to whoever wants to help contribute!

This build works on Wii and Dolphin.

Mission Statement: This project is intended to finish the work of the PMDT's development builds and create an unofficial build including all of the leaked content. This build will be based off of dev build 3.6.1, with both Knuckles and Lyn included. For those that want it, there is also the necessary files needed to revert the fighters to their 3.6 versions, while keeping all the cosmetic changes from 3.6.1. This includes Snake's new box taunt.

What This Build is NOT: This build is not aiming to be the new "tournament standard". It is simply a group of modders coming together with the common goal of finishing Project M the way it was intended to be. It is also not a new custom content mod. The goal is to stay as true to PMDT's design as possible. This build is neither a place to add tons of new characters nor rebalance the entire game. Perhaps in the future Isaac can be completed, but as of right now, the focus is on finishing what is almost done!

## Progress:

Currently it has combined the cosmetics of the Halloween Update with the changes from dev version 3.6.1. It has also added Knuckles, Lyn, and Isaac from the development build with additional cosmetic changes to Knuckles and Lyn and numerous bugfixes for both of their movesets.

## Contributing to the Project:

If you want to help contribute to the build there are a few things you can do:

* Test the current build and look for bugs/issues that directly impact the project goals. If you find a bug, submit an issue in the issue tracker with details about the issue and a suggestion on how it can be fixed.
* Contribute files to the build to address issues. Find an issue in the issue tracker that you can fix, and submit the fix back to the main build. To do so, fork the project (make a copy of your own), make changes/apply a fix, and submit a pull request back to the project (request that your changes get "pulled" into the main build). If you are having trouble, consult our guide [here](HowToContribute.md).
